Initial Figma design: [https://www.figma.com/file/lz9lLpFHMxHm2odnwM3R0z/gpt3](https://www.figma.com/file/lz9lLpFHMxHm2odnwM3R0z/gpt3)

## Bugs & Features

- Fully responsive mobile-first layout
- Reusable React functional components
- Using NewsAPI to make custom thematic blog. There\`s a small oversight: NewsAPI is paid for all use cases except for developers (`costs near $450 per month `ðŸ¥µ), so it doesn\`t work in production ðŸ˜ž. But you can run this project on localhost and enjoy how this customized blog looks!
